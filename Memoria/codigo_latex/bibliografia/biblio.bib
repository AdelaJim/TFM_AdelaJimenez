   abstract = {Wood-based materials in current additive manufacturing (AM) feedstocks are primarily restricted to the micron scale. Utilizing large-scale wood in existing AM techniques remains a challenge. This paper proposes an AM method—laser-cut veneer lamination (LcVL)—for wood-based product fabrication. Inspired by laminated object manufacturing (LOM) and plywood technology, LcVL bonds wood veneers in a layer-upon-layer manner. As demonstrated by printed samples, LcVL was able to retain the advantageous qualities of AM, specifically, the ability to manufacture products with complex geometries which would otherwise be impossible using subtractive manufacturing techniques. Furthermore, LcVL-product structures designed through adjusting internal voids and wood-texture directionality could serve as material templates or matrices for functional wood-based materials. Numerical analyses established relations between the processing resolution of LcVL and proportional veneer thickness (layer height). LcVL could serve as a basis for the further development of large-scale wood usage in AM.},

To facilitate the design and realization of PE analog and digital circuits for the augmentation of signal processing thereto, we present in this paper, a novel and comprehensive printed transistor model that is simple, accurate and compatible with industry-standard IC (integrated circuit) electronic design automation tools. Unlike reported models, the proposed comprehensive model accommodates and accurately models the effect of the channel length on carrier mobility, leakage current and parasitic capacitances, and is valid for all transistor operating regions, from cut-off to supra-threshold regions. The proposed comprehensive model further embodies process variations (statistical data) and matching based on various layout techniques. These comprehensive modelings are imperative for the practical design and simulation of PE circuits, including manufacturability and implications with respect to the challenges of PE circuits. On the basis of the proposed comprehensive model, several fundamental analog and digital PE circuits, based on conventional and novel methods, are designed and realized on plastic-films. Their measured parameters agree well with that obtained from simulations (using the model derived herein), depicting the efficacy of the comprehensive model.

Our approach relies on the combined use of standard fused filament fabrication (FFF) for the production of thermoplastic 3D freeform components, and supersonic cluster beam deposition (SCBD) for the fabrication of embedded electrical conducting lines and resistors with tailored conductivity. SCBD is an additive fabrication technique based on the deposition of neutral metallic clusters carried in a highly collimated supersonic beam. SCBD produces strongly adherent conducting layers onto polymeric substrates with electrical resistance depending only on the thickness of the cluster-assembled film. A multi-step fabrication procedure alternating FFF and SCBD was developed and optimized allowing the fabrication of conductive 3D oblique paths, bridging vias, and sockets for standard electronic components fitting. This resulted in the simplification of the topology of planar electric circuits by enabling out-of-plane connections, minimizing the implementation of bulky passive electrical components and avoiding the use of soldering and conductive adhesives for the integration of active electronic components. A dark-activated light sensor was produced as a demonstrator.},

   abstract = {The concept of four-dimensional (4D) printing emerged from the addition of the time dimension into the more established additive manufacturing (AM) methods, namely 3D printing technologies. Incorporating the element of time into 4D printing allows the resulting structures to change and adapt over time in response to external or internal stimuli such as light, heat, magnetism, electricity, solvent, pH, etc. Thus, only smart materials such as shape memory polymers, alloys, hydrogels, ceramics, and composites that possess the ability to respond to a stimulus can be used. In comparison to 3D printing, the change in structure and/or property allows for broader applications of 4D printed materials in the aerospace, biomedical, soft robotics, engineering, and fashion industries , and it has the potential to completely revolutionize the manufacturing industry. Herein, we have reviewed in detail the current developments in 4D printing, the available and new smart (shape-changing) materials, and how they respond to internal or external stimuli, following a short description of the definition, concept, and background of 4D printing. The cutting-edge current and potential applications of the 4D printed structures in the field of aerospace, biomedical, soft robotics, engineering, and fashion and apparel are reviewed in detail. Lastly, the review addresses future prospects including the potential future research areas, and market trends, as well as the challenges that need to be overcome for its widespread adoption. Although 4D printing technology is still in its very early phases of development, the possibilities are unlimited, and much like 3D printing, the future seems exciting.

Such models were used to help neu-rosurgeons understand the anatomy of the aneurysms together with the surrounding vessels and their relationships, providing, therefore, a tangible supporting tool with which to train and plan surgical operations. The starting 3D models were obtained by processing the computed tomography angiographies and the digital subtraction angiographies of three patients. Then, a 3D DLP printer was used to print the models, and, if acceptable, on the basis of the neurosurgeon's opinion, they were used for the planning of the neurosurgery operation and patient information. All the models were printed within three hours, providing a comprehensive representation of the cerebral aneurysms and the surrounding structures and improving the understanding of their anatomy and simplifying the planning of the surgical operation.},

   abstract = {This paper presents a prototype Stereolithography (STL) file format slicing and tool-path generation algorithm, which serves as a data front-end for a Rapid Prototyping (RP) entry- level three-dimensional (3-D) printer. Used mainly in Additive Manufacturing (AM), 3-D printers are devices that apply plastic, ceramic, and metal, layer by layer, in all three dimensions on a flat surface (X, Y, and Z axis). 3-D printers, unfortunately, cannot print an object without a special algorithm that is required to create the Computer Numerical Control (CNC) instructions for printing. An STL algorithm therefore forms a critical component for Layered Manufacturing (LM), also referred to as RP. The purpose of this study was to develop an algorithm that is capable of processing and slicing an STL file or multiple files, resulting in a tool-path, and finally compiling a CNC file for an entry-level 3- D printer. The prototype algorithm was implemented for an entry-level 3-D printer that utilises the Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM) process or Solid Freeform Fabrication (SFF) process; an AM technology. Following an experimental method, the full data flow path for the prototype algorithm was developed, starting with STL data files, and then processing the STL data file into a G-code file format by slicing the model and creating a tool-path. This layering method is used by most 3-D printers to turn a 2-D object into a 3-D object. The STL algorithm developed in this study presents innovative opportunities for LM, since it allows engineers and architects to transform their ideas easily into a solid model in a fast, simple, and cheap way. This is accomplished by allowing STL models to be sliced rapidly, effectively, and without error, and finally to be processed and prepared into a G-code print file.},

Adding additional degrees-of-freedom (DOF) to the AM tool could remove this limitation by enabling out of plane material deposition. For example, multi-DOF tool paths could align material extrusion with a part's stress contours to circumvent inter-layer delamination. As a step towards this goal, the authors designed, fabricated, and tested an AM extrusion system that leverages a 6-DOF robotic arm.

The microstructure of the blade post heat treated was characterised of grain growth and coarsening and the formation of the γ phase which was of the result of the transformation of . This transformation was also observed in the As-built state and is reported here for the first time. A massive crack that was observed half-way through in the built was attributed to the thermal shocks that are experienced by the almost immediately after manufacturing. The EDS and Map taken on the As-built and heat treated samples conclude that there was no segregation in the alloying element during manufacturing and that the blade was of the dual phase. Hardness results indicated the heat treated sample was 91 HV0.5 lower in hardness when compared to the As-built component. The successful print of this hollow blade indicate that γ-TNB and other Ti-Al alloys can be printed with the LENS but if a crack free sample was to be achieved the set-up had to be manipulated or addition resources must be added to adapt the set-up. Meanwhile the successes of this study show that LENS is going to be considered as a cost-effective manufacturing tool in the future for 3D printing Ti-Al and other metallic structure that would have improved properties when compared to traditional manufacturing technique such as casting and the powder bed systems.},

   abstract = {This work reports the design and validation of an innovative automatic photo-cross-linking device for robotic-based in situ bioprinting. Photo-cross-linking is the most promising polymerization technique when considering biomaterial deposition directly inside a physiological environment, typical of the in situ bioprinting approach. The photo-cross-linking device was designed for the IMAGObot platform, a 5-degree-of-freedom robot re-engineered for in situ bioprinting applications. The system consists of a syringe pump extrusion module equipped with eight light-emitting diodes (LEDs) with a 405 nm wavelength. The hardware and software of the robot were purposely designed to manage the LEDs switching on and off during printing. To minimize the light exposure of the needle, thus avoiding its clogging, only the LEDs opposite the printing direction are switched on to irradiate the newly deposited filament. Moreover, the LED system can be adjusted in height to modulate substrate exposure. Different scaffolds were bioprinted using a GelMA-based hydrogel, varying the printing speed and light distance from the bed, and were characterized in terms of swelling and mechanical properties, proving the robustness of the photo-cross-linking system in various configurations. The system was finally validated onto anthropomorphic phantoms (i.e., a human humerus head and a human hand with defects) featuring complex nonplanar surfaces. The designed system was successfully used to fill these anatomical defects, thus resulting in a promising solution for in situ bioprinting applications.},

However, within this field lies a major challenge, which is developing high resolution constructs, with complex architectures. In an effort to overcome these challenges a biofabrication technique known as vat polymerization is being increasingly investigated due to its high fabrication accuracy and control of resolution (µm scale). Despite the progress made in developing hydrogel precursors for bioprinting techniques, such as extrusion-based bioprinting, there is a major lack in developing hydrogel precursor bioresins for vat polymerization. This is due to the specific unique properties and characteristics required for vat polymerization, from lithography to the latest volumetric printing. This is of major concern as the shortage of bioresins available has a significant impact on progressing this technology and exploring its full potential, including speed, resolution, and scale. Therefore, this review discusses the key requirements that need to be addressed in successfully developing a bioresin. The influence of monomer architecture and bioresin composition on printability is described, along with key fundamental parameters that can be altered to increase printing accuracy. Finally, recent advancements in bioresins are discussed together with future directions.},

The deliberate shaping direction of the top-down CLIP strategy not only improved the printing speed, but also enabled full utilization of the natural oxygen in the air to generate the liquid interface on the top of the photocurable resin, ensuring that the printing process can be carried out continuously. These printed 3D-polysiloxane components can be further converted into dense and crack-free 3D-SiOC ceramics with a smooth surface upon a heat treatment.

   abstract = {Because most industrial robots are taught using the di-rect teaching and playback method, they are unsuit-able for variable production systems. Alternatively, the offline teaching method has limited applications because of the low accuracy of the position and posture of the end-effector. Therefore, many studies have been conducted to calibrate the position and posture. Positioning errors of robots can be divided into kinematic and non-kinematic errors. In some studies, kinematic errors are calibrated by kinematic models, and non-kinematic errors are calibrated by neural networks. However, the factor of the positioning errors has not been identified because the neural network is a black box. In another machine learning method, a random forest is constructed from decision trees, and its struc-ture can be visualized. Therefore, we used a random forest method to construct a calibration model for the positioning errors and to identify the positioning error factors. The proposed calibration method is based on a simulation of many candidate points centered on the target point. A large industrial robot was used, and the 3D coordinates of the end-effector were obtained using a laser tracker. The model predicted the positioning error from end-effector coordinates, joint angles, and joint torques using the random forest method. As a re-sult, the positioning error was predicted with a high accuracy. The random forest analysis showed that joint 2 was the primary factor of the X-and Z-axis errors. This suggests that the air cylinder used as an auxiliary to the servo motor of joint 2, which is unique to large industrial robots, is the error factor. With the proposed calibration, the positioning error norm was reduced at all points.},

@article{Zheng_2022,
   abstract = {Offline programming is an intuitive and automatic programming generation technique that does not use real robotic systems, thus greatly decreasing the downtime required for system programming, and resulting in enormous savings in terms of labor costs. Currently, offline programming can be generally categorized into computer-aided-design-based (CAD-based) and vision-based approaches; these two types of offline programming approaches have been widely applied in robotic welding systems. However, owing to the highly complex and diverse workpieces needed in the shipbuilding industry, neither of the aforementioned offline programming approaches can fully support the automatic generation of welding programs. In this paper, a hybrid offline programming method systematically combining CAD-based, vision-based, and vision & CAD interactive activities is proposed to overcome the limitations of current automatic program generation methods for robotic welding systems. In the vision-based activities, the positions of the workpieces are obtained by using geometrical features gathered from the workpieces’ images, whereas in the CAD-based activities, the welding tasks are assigned to different mobile components of the welding torch; then, their welding paths are planned according to the workpieces’ CAD models. The vision & CAD interactive activities enable the mapping between the point cloud of a workpiece and its CAD model, so that the deviations caused by assembly errors can be detected and path compensation data can be determined. The effectiveness of the proposed hybrid offline programming method is demonstrated by integrating it into a subassembly welding robotic system. The experimental results indicate that this method can significantly improve the efficiency, accuracy, and flexibility of the robotic welding system.},

On the basis of force feedback, provided from a 1-axis load cell, the nominal deburring trajectory is optimised and deformed making multiple repetitions. The deburring trajectory is repeated until completing the nominal deburring path. The removal of thin layers of materials allows the robot to operate at high feed rates avoiding spindle stall and without exciting elastics effects on the mechanical structure of the system. Furthermore, a method to automatically detect the force changepoints, related to the presence of a burr, without tuning force thresholds, is discussed.

No obstante, se encuentran ciertas dificultades a la hora de lograr una calibración offline de la estación robotizada para reducir los errores de posicionamiento absoluto y lograr una mayor precisión en el mecanizado, sobre todo en mecanizados ligeros a partir de preforma. Este trabajo pretende establecer una metodología de definición de sistemas de referencia pre-proceso en una estación de mecanizado robótico a fin de minimizar el error asociado a la incertidumbre en la definición de la estación y la sujeción de la pieza. Esta metodología está basada en el flujo de trabajo de la máquina de control numérico en cuanto a los sistemas de referencia definidos, empleando soluciones parametrizadas con alta intercambiabilidad basadas en tecnologías de instrumentación de bajo coste. Para validar esta metodología se han realizado dos validaciones cuantitativas para determinar el error de posicionamiento absoluto; así como una validación del flujo de trabajo completo. Se han obtenido resultados de error de posicionamiento absoluto lineal en el entorno de 0.3mm y error de posicionamiento absoluto angular alrededor de 0.1º, resultados que se consideran satisfactorios y en línea con el estado de la técnica.

   abstract = {The next chapter of the robotics revolution is well underway with the deployment of robots for a broad range of commercial use cases. Even in a myriad of applications and environments, there exists a common vocabulary of components that robots share—the need for a modular, scalable, and reliable architecture; sensing; planning; mobility; and autonomy. The Robot Operating System (ROS) was an integral part of the last chapter, demonstrably expediting robotics research with freely available components and a modular framework. However, ROS 1 was not designed with many necessary production-grade features and algorithms. ROS 2 and its related projects have been redesigned from the ground up to meet the challenges set forth by modern robotic systems in new and exploratory domains at all scales. In this Review, we highlight the philosophical and architectural changes of ROS 2 powering this new chapter in the robotics revolution. We also show through case studies the influence ROS 2 and its adoption has had on accelerating real robot systems to reliable deployment in an assortment of challenging environments.},

   abstract = {In the current era of Industry 4.0, smart manufacturing systems seek to achieve a high level of flexibility and efficiency. This can be achieved by means of incorporating a high degree of automation and autonomous robotized systems along with efficient decision-making systems capable to reconfigure the system tasks in real-time according to the external demands and perturbations. For the fast development of the digital twins of manufacturing plants that include some robotic devices, it is advantageous to use discrete-event simulators, for production process modeling, and the existing virtual environments of the robots and automatic devices. This work proposes the design and construction of software architecture capable of integrating discrete-event process simulators with the well-known Robot Operating System (ROS) allowing easily interchange information between the factory components for fast digital twin development of robotized manufacturing systems. In addition, our proposal allows for a straightforward integration between the digital twin with an autonomous decision-making system. The proposed ROS-based architecture is tested using different discrete-event simulators and the free distribution ROS Melodic. Finally, we present an instance of software architecture for a typical complex case study of manufacturing plants and demonstrate its easy integration with an autonomous decision-making system.},

ABSTRACT = {Autonomous vehicles are rapidly emerging as a crucial sector within the automotive industry. Several companies are investing in the development and enhancement of technologies, which presents challenging problems in the context of robotics and control. In particular, this work primarily focuses on the creation of an autonomous vehicle architecture utilizing the robotic operating system (ROS2) framework, accompanied by advanced control algorithms. In order to facilitate the development and implementation of lateral vehicle dynamics controllers, a reduced-size automated car available in GIPSA-Lab is used as an experimental platform. The objective is to design robust controllers capable of achieving optimal tracking and stability. Accordingly, this problem is tackled under different robust control syntheses, considering the H∞ approach: using linear time-invariant (LTI) and linear parameter-varying (LPV) model representations. Several simulation and experimental results are included to demonstrate the efficiency of the controllers.},

ABSTRACT = {The Condition Monitoring (CM) of industrial collaborative robots (cobots) has the potential to decrease downtimes in highly automated production systems. However, in such complex systems, defining a strategy for effective CM and automatically detecting failures is not straightforward. In this paper, common issues related to the application of CM to collaborative manipulators are first introduced, discussed, and then, a solution based on the Robot Operating System (ROS) is proposed. The content of this document is highly oriented towards applied research and the novelty of this work mainly lies in the proposed CM architecture, while the methodology chosen to assess the manipulator’s health is based on previous research content. The CM architecture developed and the relative strategy used to process data are useful for the definition of algorithms for the automatic detection of failures. The approach is based on data labeling and indexing and aims to extract comparable data units to easily detect possible failure. The end of this paper is provided with a proof of concept (PoC) applied to an industrial collaborative manipulator where the proposed CM strategy has been implemented and tested in a real application scenario. Finally, it is shown how the proposed methodology enables the possibility of defining standard Health Indicators (HIs) to detect joint anomalies using torque information even under a highly dynamic and non-stationary environmental conditions.},

   abstract = {The spread adoption of humanoid social robots in different application fields is growing the interest of hackers who could violate the privacy of people, or—even worse—threaten humans’ life from physical and emotional/social point of views. Different vectors of attack exist, which are more easily exploitable if physical access to the target robot is available. This is very likely for humanoids that typically reside in untrusted environments where physically access to the robot is allowed and expected, thus permitting anyone to exploit the Linux kernel vulnerability (e.g., through the insertion of a USB pen drive) with the objective of tampering sensitive data. The Robot Operating System (ROS) is at the core of humanoids. Thus, it is crucial for their security. The most-recent solutions introduced in ROS2, SROS, and H-ROS are not sufficient for facing powerful adversaries. In this paper, we first identify the uncovered ROS weaknesses, which are particularly worrying in the case of humanoids. Then, we present our patched ROS solution called Trusted-ROS (TROS) leveraging hardware-assisted trusted computing to shield data managed by ROS, which otherwise would reside in robot’s memory unencrypted. The design of TROS is reported, together with a prototype implementation using a simulated version of the NAO humanoid secured through an Intel SGX hardware. Finally, we evaluated the proposed solution from both security and performance perspectives in order to demonstrate the practicability of our approach.},

@report{TFM_Lu,
   abstract = {Since Industry 4.0, the use of robots in manufacturing processes across various sectors has been steadily increasing. Notable among these manufacturing processes are machining operations and 3D additive manufacturing. Currently, the most widely used technology for machining parts is Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machines, while the most advanced technology for 3D additive manufacturing is 3D printing. However, both manufacturing processes face two main limitations: a limited workspace, restricting them from working with large-sized parts, and a low degree of freedom, making it difficult to work with parts with complex structures. Consequently, to address these limitations, many researchers are developing projects such as robotic machining and robotized 3D additive manufacturing, employing 6-degree-of-freedom robots, as robots are more compact, offer a larger workspace, and provide greater flexibility.

One of the most significant challenges in using robots is generating precise trajectories for the robot to follow and extending the data processing capacity of the robots. Regarding trajectory generation, there can be many factors that alter the final result, and one of the main factors is the calibration of the workstation. Additionally, to improve data processing capacity, there is the possibility of processing the data using external robot software.

In this exploratory work, the aim is to build a ROS ecosystem for integration into robotic manufacturing to study the possibilities offered by ROS and how that ecosystem manages to overcome the limitations of current manufacturing techniques. The validation of the objective of this work is carried out through two tests: (1) Extrinsic calibration of the workstation; (2) Trajectory tracking of complex paths. In the first test, a methodology for extrinsic calibration has been developed using the ROS ecosystem and a cobot. In the second test, the goal is to implement complex trajectories in the ROS ecosystem and use a cobot to analyze how the results approach the precision characteristic of operations performed on a CNC machine.

Upon analyzing the results, it is worth noting that a bug has been found in a cartesian path planning function of the MoveIt! software during the first test, leading to non-linear movement in some parts of the executed trajectories. After performing extrinsic calibration of the workstation, an improvement of the order of a millimeter is observed in trajectory compensation, and it is discovered that there could be an intrinsic robot calibration error. Subsequently, when analyzing the results of the second test, it has been verified that the error is reduced with the developed compensation model; however, it is not completely compensated, as it presents error trending along the trajectory. It is estimated that this would be a combination of the robot's intrinsic calibration error and the extrinsic calibration of the station for not integrating said calibration into the ROS ecosystem. To address this, future work has been proposed to validate this test.

In conclusion, the main objective of this work, which is to explore ROS to study the possibility of integrating it into robotic manufacturing, has been successfully achieved. A ROS-based ecosystem has been built to carry out the two proposed tests. Future developments have been proposed to extend this work, including: (1) Full integration of the workflow developed in ROS; (2) Compensating for the robot's intrinsic calibration error; (3) Developing controllers to compensate for errors due to robot-generated oscillations; (4) Conducting a lightweight machining or 3D additive manufacturing test using the developed workflow to compare the manufactured parts with those produced using traditional techniques; (5) Developing a digital twin of the workstation using Gazebo. Finally, it is worth mentioning that a greater understanding has been acquired about ROS, Linux system, C++, XML, different libraries, and software.},

   abstract = {The layer-wise deposition of Additive Manufacturing (AM) processes allows for significant freedom in the design of product geometry; however, the use of 3-axis deposition tools results in layer interfaces that reduce material properties in the build direction. Adding additional degrees-of-freedom (DOF) to the AM tool could remove this limitation by enabling out of plane material deposition. For example, multi-DOF tool paths could align material extrusion with a part's stress contours to circumvent inter-layer delamination. As a step towards this goal, the authors designed, fabricated, and tested an AM extrusion system that leverages a 6-DOF robotic arm. In this paper, the authors detail the realization of this system including the design of a high-temperature filament extruder, kinematics and tool path generation, and user interface. The performance of the system is evaluated through layered deposition of ABS thermoplastic.},

AM processes are categorized into seven groups, the one relevant to this project is called Material Extrusion (MEX), commonly known as 3D printing. As the name suggests, it involves extruding melted material through a nozzle. In recent years, the trend in additive manufacturing has been the integration of robots into the process, aiming to produce parts with more complex geometries, control the main stress directions, and reduce the amount of support material used in the process.

At the ETSII - UPM, a non-flat additive manufacturing station assisted by a collaborative robotic arm UR10 is being developed. In this station, the extruder is fixed to a structure and the print bed is manipulated by the six-degree-of-freedom robotic arm, although the process uses only five. The objective of this project is to design, manufacture, inspect, and validate up to a TRL 4 a heated bed for the non-flat 3D printer, whose print surface is a cylinder.

The function of the bed is divided into two main functions. The first is to serve as a reference in the initial calibration of the station, for this purpose, it has two cubes whose faces are within very tight tolerances to precisely define the reference system of the bed. Its other main function is to heat the surface of the cylinder to ensure that the material deposited by the extruder adheres correctly.},

   abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM) has been adopted by high-value-added industries to revolutionize product life cycle performance, from advantageous design topology to functional advances. Compared with conventional manufacturing methods such as tooling and molding, the design constraints induced by AM usually include support structures, building direction (BD), feedstock material properties, and process parameters. These new factors need to be considered in AM-driven product design and manufacturing. In this study, an AM-driven topology optimization method coupled with a transversely isotropic material model and solid anisotropic material with penalization (SAMP) is proposed to establish a quantitative correlation between process-related parameters and the mechanical properties of printed materials, further implementing such correlation for process and topology optimization using a gradient-based algorithm. Specifically, the coordinate transformation matrix is combined with the transversely isotropic stiffness and strength of the printed material using stereolithography apparatus (SLA) to describe the elastic matrix under different BDs. Thereafter, case-dependent product performances are investigated based on an integrated method considering the net-effect of structural design and BD. The proposed approach can easily achieve AM-driven topology optimization of complex products with desirable mechanical performance. Furthermore, the established topological model can be broadly applied to complex functional part design and optimization, as well as case studies on AM-driven product evaluation.},

A numerical simulation of distortions promoted by residual stresses during the additive process was employed to consider material allowance. The status of the as-built and post-processed component was analysed through scanning and CMM inspection and roughness measurements. The 3D scanned model of the as-built LPBF-ed component was used to understand the distortion behaviour of the component and compared to the numerical simulation. Finally, 5-axis milling operations were conducted in some critical surfaces in order to improve surface quality and dimensional accuracy of the as-built component. The inspection of the as-built and post-processed component showed the improvement achieved through the proposed hybrid approach.

Therefore, in this study, a sustainable route to converting plastic waste into additive manufacturing (AM) feedstock is presented, where waste plastic bottles (mainly Polyethylene Terephthalate, PET) are recycled using an in-house 3D-printed filament extrusion system to produce filaments for fused filament fabrication (FFF) process. In addition to the recycled PET (rPET), virgin carbon fiber reinforced polyamide-6 (PA6-CF) polymer composites were also used to produce hybrid feedstock filaments. The rPET and rPET/PA6-CF composite filaments were extruded using an in-house filament extruder setup. The produced rPET-based filaments were characterized for their chemical and thermal properties. Subsequently , mechanical characterization was performed on 3D-printed specimens. The mechanical analysis revealed better tensile strength for rPET/PA6-CF than rPET; however, the rPET demonstrated better failure strain and young modulus, demonstrating their potential as viable materials for industrial and consumer applications. The outcomes of this study revealed promising results to promote sustainable production and consumption, complementing the circular economy practices with a straightforward production route to convert plastic waste into AM feedstock.},

In this article, new optimization and path planning methods for multi-axis additive manufacturing are presented going beyond conventional three-axis systems. This includes an adaptation of the building direction and an algorithm for the special case of cylindrical axes. These methods can reduce the production time drastically by avoiding support structures and by using the integration of predefined building blocks to substitute the infill. We present both, the new manufacturing process and the necessary computation methods for optimal process and path planning. Decreasing the building time and the amount of support structures paves the way for new application domains of additive manufacturing in the future.},

   abstract = {Laser directed-energy deposition (DED) offers notable advantages in additive manufacturing (AM) for producing intricate geometries and facilitating material functional grading. However, inherent challenges such as material property inconsistencies and part variability persist, predominantly due to its layer-wise fabrication approach. Critical to these challenges is heat accumulation during DED, influencing the resultant material microstructure and properties. Although closed-loop control methods for managing heat accumulation and temperature regulation are prevalent in DED literature, few approaches integrate real-time monitoring, physics-based modeling, and control simultaneously in a cohesive framework. To address this, we present a digital twin (DT) framework for real-time model predictive control of process parameters of the DED for achieving a specific process design objective. To enable its implementation, we detail the development of a surrogate model utilizing Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-based machine learning which uses Bayesian Inference to predict temperatures across various spatial locations of the DED-built part. This model offers real-time predictions of future temperature states. In addition, we introduce a Bayesian Optimization (BO) method for Time Series Process Optimization (BOTSPO). Its foundational principles align with traditional BO, and its novelty lies in our unique time series process profile generator with a reduced dimensional representation. BOTSPO is used for dynamic process optimization in which we deploy BOTSPO to determine the optimal laser power profile, aiming to achieve desired mechanical properties in a DED build. The identified profile establishes a process trajectory that online process optimizations aim to match or exceed in performance. This paper elucidates components of the digital twin framework, advocating its prospective consolidation into a comprehensive digital twin system for AM.},

Key mechanical property metrics are presented, including strain hardening rate, yield strength, and Young’s modulus as a function of thickness and testing temperature (ambient, 250 °C, and 450 °C). The effect of specimen size on manufacturing-induced microstructural feature formation is demonstrated and discussed. A detailed analysis regarding Young’s modulus, yield strength, and strain hardening rate variation at elevated temperatures is also presented. Size effect and temperature-sensitive deformation mechanisms are linked to the underlying microstructural deformation mechanisms activated at respective temperatures. Counter-intuitively, this study determined that irrespective of the geometry, strain hardening rates increased as temperature increased. An in-depth microstructural examination is presented to explain the stated observation. The texture of Interrupted tensile test samples examined for ambient, 250 °C, and 450 °C post-yield was observed to be unchanged, indicating the strain hardening behavior was not texture dependent. Schmid factor analysis, coupled with experimental findings from previous work, was implemented to generate a hypothesis. This hypothesis suggests that the drop in critical resolved shear stress for basal and pyramidal slip systems, as temperature increases, paired with the high dislocation density of laser powder bed fusion Ti-6Al-4V, leads to dislocation entanglement and results in increased strain hardening at elevated temperatures.}

ABSTRACT = {Additive Manufacturing (AM) brought a revolution in parts design and production. It enables the possibility to obtain objects with complex geometries and to exploit structural optimization algorithms. Nevertheless, AM is far from being a mature technology and advances are still needed from different perspectives. Among these, the literature highlights the need of improving the frameworks that describe the design process and taking full advantage of the possibilities offered by AM. This work aims to propose a workflow for AM guiding the designer during the embodiment design phase, from the engineering requirements to the production of the final part. The main aspects are the optimization of the dimensions and the topology of the parts, to take into consideration functional and manufacturing requirements, and to validate the geometric model by computer-aided engineering software. Moreover, a case study dealing with the redesign of a piston rod is presented, in which the proposed workflow is adopted. Results show the effectiveness of the workflow when applied to cases in which structural optimization could bring an advantage in the design of a part and the pros and cons of the choices made during the design phases were highlighted.},

   abstract = {Conventional planar slicing methods for additive manufacturing limit manufacturable geometries and cause anisotropy and surface defects. Non-planar layers may address this problem; however, their complexity hinder automatic trajectory generation. This paper presents an algorithm for slicing part models and defining trajectories in axisymmetric layers using parametric curves as generatrix for surface creation. The algorithm is based on two coordinate systems, the Cartesian coordinate system \{c\} and a slicing coordinate system \{s\}. Thus, by defining planar layers in \{s\}, the model can be sliced with non-planar uniform layers parallel to the build platform. Commercial software was used to define these planar layers in \{s\}. To validate the methodology, two case studies have been defined and validated in a robotized additive manufacturing cell. The precision of this implementation has been validated by simulating the extrusion of material in the generated trajectories while measuring the distance between the extruder and the build platform. The results show how the variation in this measurement is dependent on the complexity of the geometry but consistent with repetitions, obtaining values of uncertainty ranging from ± 250 to ± 350[μm]. This methodology may enable new mechanical properties design for biomedical applications, structural components, soft robotics, or aerospace industry among others.},

First, tests for deposition processes in single layer and multiple layers were conducted under various depositing conditions by changing the laser output and the amount of powder. The test results have clarified depositing conditions where less pores are generated, differences in hardness by deposited position, and the factors for those differences.},

In this frame, laser-aided Directed Metal Deposition (DMD) with injection of powder is investigated in this paper since minimal distortion of the work-piece, reduced heat-affected zones and better surface quality are benefited in comparison with conventional techniques. Actual application to overhaul Ni-based components is aimed, therefore homologous powder is fed by means of a 3-way feeding nozzle over the substrate; a disc laser is used as heat source. The chemical composition of both the substrate and the powder is preliminarily investigated via areal and punctual EDS inspections. A 2-factor, 2-level experimental plan is drawn to discuss the main effects of the processing variables laser power and processing speed. Namely, the resulting trends are given and compared with similar findings in the literature. Interestingly, dilution as a measure of metal affection is found to be lower than 25\%, hence the operating window is deemed to be suitable for both repairing and fabrication of parts. Eventually, repairing by means of side overlapping and multi-level deposition traces on artificial square-shaped grooves is performed: indeed, similar slots are made before DMD to preliminarily remove any local imperfection upon improper casting of the part in the actual industrial process. Although a number of micropores are found, the process is deemed to comply with usual referred standards; in particular, a proper processing window has been found to prevent the occurrence of hot cracking which usually affects the compliance to stress.},

It finds broad application in the automotive, biomedical, and aerospace industries. The Research Center for Advanced Manufacturing (RCAM) at Southern Methodist University is developing a robot controlled LBDMD system that couples a 6-axis robot arm with an additional 2-axis tilt and rotatory positioning system. The system simplifies the process planning of multiple directional deposition for complex parts and reduces production time. This paper describes the printing process specific to complex revolved parts. Taking advantage of the coupled 2-axis tilt and ro-tatory system, a hybrid slicing method is developed to map the overhanging structures of a revolved part to be at a planar base. Consequently, the traditional path planning strategies are applicable to generate the tool-path for the mapped structures. The method is successfully applied to build a propeller.},

For initial position guiding, a motion path with the least energy consumption is generated based on the weighted optimal control; then the path is revised for avoiding obstacles by setting the path tags dynamically. For seam tracking, the seam is dispersed into discrete welding points; then the welding gun moves through each point according to the welding sequence.

   abstract = {In order for a robotic manipulator to perform useful work, it must be programmed to accomplish the desired task or motion cycle. Nowadays industrial robots generally require a tremendous amount of programming to make them useful. Their controllers are very sophisticated, the commercial robot programming environments are typically closed systems and the programming languages varies from manufacturer to manufacturer. Despite the great evolution of the industrial robots controllers, in the majority of the industrial applications, the robot programming is made, using one of the following ways: • Manual on-line programming; • Off-line programming; Manual on-line programming refers to physically teaching a robot the required trajectory, through interaction with teach pendant or other similar device (Lee & ElMaraghy, 1990). This programming kind presents the following disadvantages: very slow, it needs that the robot is available, difficulty in the handling of equipments, need some practice in the language used by the robot, and technical knowledge to understand the operation of the equipment. These disadvantages are very expensive in the industry because the productive process needs to stop for a long time. One simple approach to solve some disadvantages described above is the Off-line programming environments. These environments are based in graphical simulation platforms, in which the programming and execution process are shown using models of the real objects. Consequently, the robot programmer has to learn only the simulation language and not any of the robot programming languages. Other benefits in off-line programming environments include libraries of pre-defined high-level commands for certain types of applications, such as painting or welding, and the possibility to assess the kinematics feasibility of a move, thus enabling the user to plan collision-free paths. The simulation may also be used to determine the cycle time for a sequence of movements. These environments usually provide a set of primitives commonly used by various robots, and produce a sequence of robot manipulator language primitives such as ”move” or ”open gripper” that are then downloaded in the respective robot controllers. However, the off-line programming tools based in graphically 3D representation presents several problems in many industry applications, particularly, when the robot task or the robot trajectory needs frequent changes, for example: in welding applications where the configuration of the pieces to weld change frequently (the size, the shape, etc.); the robot painting and gluing applications can have similar problems. Nowadays, the CAD tools are often used in the industry to develop and to document the products and its manufacture. There are a lot of commercial CAD tools, like, AutoCAD, SolidWorks, Ideas and Cimatron, having each tool its own file format. However, it is possible to export the information of these pieces, in a neutral file format, namely: STL, IGES, STEP and SET formats. This work presents one solution for programming different robots based in the relevant information extracted from neutral files. The solution implemented was tested in the industrial robots Mitsubishi (Mitsubishi Move Master Industrial Robot) and ABB (model IRB 140 with IRC5 controller). This chapter is organized as follows: section 2 presents an overview about the format of neutral files (STL, IGS, STEP and SET); in the section 3, the algorithms for extraction of the relevant information from the neutral files are described; in the section 4, the developed tool for code generation for different industrial robots is presented; section 5 and 6 present the results and conclusions; section 7 presents future work.},

   abstract = {Offline programming is an intuitive and automatic programming generation technique that does not use real robotic systems, thus greatly decreasing the downtime required for system programming, and resulting in enormous savings in terms of labor costs. Currently, offline programming can be generally categorized into computer-aided-design-based (CAD-based) and vision-based approaches; these two types of offline programming approaches have been widely applied in robotic welding systems. However, owing to the highly complex and diverse workpieces needed in the shipbuilding industry, neither of the aforementioned offline programming approaches can fully support the automatic generation of welding programs. In this paper, a hybrid offline programming method systematically combining CAD-based, vision-based, and vision & CAD interactive activities is proposed to overcome the limitations of current automatic program generation methods for robotic welding systems. In the vision-based activities, the positions of the workpieces are obtained by using geometrical features gathered from the workpieces’ images, whereas in the CAD-based activities, the welding tasks are assigned to different mobile components of the welding torch; then, their welding paths are planned according to the workpieces’ CAD models. The vision & CAD interactive activities enable the mapping between the point cloud of a workpiece and its CAD model, so that the deviations caused by assembly errors can be detected and path compensation data can be determined. The effectiveness of the proposed hybrid offline programming method is demonstrated by integrating it into a subassembly welding robotic system. The experimental results indicate that this method can significantly improve the efficiency, accuracy, and flexibility of the robotic welding system.},

   abstract = {The industrial robot programming is a work for specialist in robotics. Today, this work is very hard because there are many robot manufacturers with different languages and different programming environments. Although, off-line programming is an way that can reduce drastically the machines stop time to maintenance. With the use of object oriented design patterns, it is possible minimize the time spent in robot programming. In this work is proposed a off-line programming environment. This tool is based in one abstract model to program robots, encapsulate in java classes. This way has the main advantage of best source code utilization. Grouping the business classes in modules by functionalities, we can reduce complexity between low matching. Recognized patterns like Facade and Template Method will construct the base to develop this programming framework. The programming robot languages tested in this work was Rapid, Karel and Melfa Basic IV, respectively languages used by ABB, Fanuc and Mitsubishi constructors.},

@inproceedings{Wei_2018,
   abstract = {Many metal components, especially large-sized ones, need to be ground or deburred after turning or milling to improve the surface qualities, which heavily depends on human interventions. Robot arms, combining movable platforms, are applied to reduce the human work. However, robots and human should work together due to the fact that most of the large-sized parts belong to small-batch products, resulting in a large number of programming for operating a robot and movable platform. Targeting the problem, this paper proposes a new interface architecture towards minimum programming in human-robot collaboration. Within the context, a four-layer architecture is designed: user interface, function block (FB), functional modules and hardware. The user interface is associated with use cases. Then, FB, with embedded algorithms and knowledge and driven by events, is to provide a dynamic link to the relevant application interface (APIs) of the functional modules in terms of the case requirements. The functional modules are related to the hardware and software functions; and the hardware and humans are considered in terms of the conditions on shop floors. This method provides three-level applications based on the skills of users: (1) the operators on shop floors, can operate both robots and movable platforms programming-freely; (2) engineers are able to customise the functions and tasks by dragging/dropping and linking the relevant FBs with minimum programming; (3) the new functions can be added by importing the APIs through programming.},

abstract="This chapter deals with the problem of compliance errors compensation in robotic-based milling. Contrary to previous works that assume that the forces/torques generated by the manufacturing process are constant, the interaction between the milling tool and the workpiece is modeled in details. It takes into account the tool geometry, the number of teeth, the feed rate, the spindle rotation speed and the properties of the material to be processed. Due to high level of the disturbing forces/torques, the developed compensation technique is based on the non-linear stiffness model that allows us to modify the target trajectory taking into account nonlinearities and to avoid the chattering effect. Illustrative example is presented that deals with robotic-based milling of aluminum alloy.",

Many challenges have slowed down the adoption or sometimes inhibited the use of robots for machining tasks. This paper deals with the current usage and status of robots in machining, as well as the necessary modelling and identification for enabling optimization, process planning and process control. Recent research addressing deburring, milling, incremental forming, polishing or thin wall machining is presented. We discuss various processes in which robots need to deal with significant process forces while fulfilling their machining task.},
